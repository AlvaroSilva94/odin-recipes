    <h1>Lasagna:</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpg" alt="Delicious Lasagna" height="400" weight="400">

    <h3>Description:</h3>
    <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. 
       A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. 
       I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Meat: This lasagna recipe starts with a pound of ground meat (½ pound ground pork, ½ pound lean ground beef).</li>
        <li>Onion: A diced onion is cooked until translucent with the ground meat.</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: You'll need a can of tomato sauce and tomatoes to crush.</li>
        <li>Fresh herbs: For fresh flavor, chop two tablespoons of parsley and crush one clove of garlic.</li>
        <li>Spices and seasonings: This homemade lasagna is seasoned with dried basil, dried oregano, salt, and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Lasagna sheets: Of course, you'll need lasagna sheets! This recipe calls for uncooked sheets, but you can use the oven-ready variety to save time.</li>
        <li>Cheese: The cheese layer is made up of cottage cheese and Parmesan. You'll also need shredded mozzarella.</li>
        <li>Eggs: Eggs make the cheese layer extra creamy. Plus, they act as a binding agent (which means they hold the layer together).</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><p>Combine pork and ground beef in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat; 
            cook and stir until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes. 
            Add onion and cook until translucent, about 5 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, garlic, basil, salt, oregano, and sugar. 
            Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 30 minutes.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. 
            Cook lasagna noodles in the boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, 8 to 10 minutes.
            Drain and set aside.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>While the lasagna sheets are cooking, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</p></li>
        <li><p>Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, remaining 1 tablespoon fresh parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl until combined.</p></li>
        <li><p>Assemble lasagna: Spread a spoon or two of sauce over the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish just to to coat it. 
               <br>A layer of sheets over the sauce to cover. Layer with 1/2 of the cheese mixture, 1/2 of the remaining sauce, and 1/2 of the mozzarella cheese.</br>
               Repeat layers once more.
               Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil.</p></li>
        <li><p>Bake in the preheated oven for 30 to 40 minutes.
               <br>Remove the foil and bake until cheese is golden brown, 5 to 10 more minutes.</br></p></li>
        <li><p>Remove from the oven and let stand for 10 minutes before cutting and serving.</p></li>
    </ol>
